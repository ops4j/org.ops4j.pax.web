	The only working way to configure a context in pax-web-jetty is to:
	 - put WEB-INF/jetty-web.xml or WEB-INF/web-jetty.xml into the WAB/WAR, or
	 - put it into know location and configure org.ops4j.pax.web.context.file option
	 - use root element <Configure> with id="Context", as that's the ID under which we can find an instance
	   of org.ops4j.pax.web.service.jetty.internal.PaxWebServletContextHandler
