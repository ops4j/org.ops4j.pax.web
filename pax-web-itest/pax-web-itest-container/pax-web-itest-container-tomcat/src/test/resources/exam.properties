# for "cdi" we use PaxExam.delegate = org.ops4j.pax.exam.junit.impl.InjectingRunner
# otherwise it's PaxExam.delegate = org.ops4j.pax.exam.junit.impl.ProbeRunner
# "test" adds some default @Configuration Option[]
# "default" allows manual control over provided @Configuration/Option[]
pax.exam.system = default
